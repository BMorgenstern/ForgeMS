This hack is intended to be patched over Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones
It creates a Forge system to be overlayed with the game's native shop UI.

The Forge allows users to purchase rare items, that require ingredients to create.
Different items are available the more you progress through the story, and depend on which forging character you buy from.

Ingredients are picked out of a global list of all the items held by individual characters and held in storage, prioritizing the items with the fewest uses for removal.

The UI has been updated to render text pretaining to the item when it's higlighted and before it's purchased.
